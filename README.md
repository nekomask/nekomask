Hi! I'm a full-stack software engineer living in the SF Bay Area. I graduated from General Assembly coding bootcamp in 2022. I also have a real Bachelor's degree
but you probably don't care about that. When I'm not coding I like to ride bikes, read manga, play video games, and exercise when I'm feeling motivated.</p>
<p align="center">
I'm currently persuing a certification in Javascript data structures & algorithms and I'm taking a Udemy course in Java on the side.</p>
<p align="center">
My goal is to be employed by a company that recognizes my potential with a team that will support me and help me continue to learn and grow. We all start somewhere right?</p>
